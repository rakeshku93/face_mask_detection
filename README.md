# face_mask_detection using tensorflow

## Problem
We are in a time when a global pandemic has paralyzed most of the nations in the globe. The most crucial weapon that we have against this disease is SOCIAL DISTANCING and installation of PROTECTIVE GEAR. When we say protective gear the most common method is the face mask. The problem at hand is to detect people who arent wearing a mask. We have a set of images of people with and without masks. So, the ultimate goal is to detect people and detect whether they are wearing a mask or not.

## Solution
To detect the faces in the image, I have leveraged OpenCV. I have created a deep learning model, to learn from all the images present, optimized it. The model is trained and optimized to detect and classify masked and nonmasked individuals. The model can be applied to an image or a video or a live feed. Currently leveraging it to the video feed.
